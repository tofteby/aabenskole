--Summary--
This module provides formatters for field collection that group every value of a multi-valued
field collection, using group options provided from the field_group module.

--Word of caution--
The way this module is implemented is quite hackish, and requires black magic to work.
Basically, field_group is being used in a way that it was not meant to be used.
This module was tested on field_group-7.x-1.3, but it is quite likely to not work for future
versions of field_group.

--Future--
In retrospect, field_group is not made to be used for grouping arbitrary render arrays. It is a
module for grouping specifically node fields in administration and front-end. Maybe such a
module exists, or will be created in the future. Then this module could be rewritten to use that.

--Similar modules--
field_collection_fieldset module is similar in idea, but it works with fieldsets only, and
does not require field_group module.
